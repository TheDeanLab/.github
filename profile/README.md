# Dean Lab

## Mission
The **Dean Lab** is dedicated to the development and application of advanced microscopy instrumentation and analysis techniques. Our goal is to unravel complex biological problems that have remained elusive. As part of the **National Cancer Institute Cellular Cancer Biology Imaging Research Center**, we engage in dynamic collaborations with leading scientists to create scalable solutions, enhancing our understanding of early metastatic colonization events.

### Collaborations
Our key collaborators include:
- **Dr. Gaudenz Danuser** (*UT Southwestern Medical Center*)
- **Dr. Reto Fiolka** (*UT Southwestern Medical Center*)
- **Dr. Sean Morrison** (*UT Southwestern Medical Center*)
- **Dr. Jim Amatruda** (*University of Southern California*)
- **Dr. Peter Sorger** (*Harvard Medical School*)

## Research and Development
As part of the **National Institutes of General Medical Sciences Biomedical Technology Development and Dissemination Center**, our lab, in collaboration with **Drs. Klaus Hahn and Gaudenz Danuser**, focuses on making advanced optical probes, light-sheet microscopes, and time-series analysis software accessible to a diverse international user base. 

### Impact and Outreach
Our collaborative efforts at **UT Southwestern Medical Center** bridge the gap between basic and clinical sciences, significantly enhancing our understanding of clinically relevant biological processes. We are committed to fostering a collaborative ecosystem where advances in microscopy not only provide answers to existing biological questions but also inspire new inquiries and drive the development of innovative imaging techniques tailored to biological research.

## Location
The Dean Lab is part of the **Cecil H. and Ida Green Department of Systems Biology**, and the **Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics** at **UT Southwestern Medical Center**.
